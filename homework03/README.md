# Homework 03: Turbidity Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes the turbidity of the five most recent data points from the water quality data provided by J. Wallen at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjallen/turbidity/main/turbidity_data.json`. It calculates the average turbidity, determines wheter or not it is under the turbidity threshold, and reports a time to threshold should the average turbidity exceed the threshold.

## Required Data
Data required to run the scripts included in this program is accessed via the url `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjallen/turbidity/main/turbidity_data.json` and the python `requests` library. If `requests` is not installed on your machine please do so as follows:
```
pip3 install --user requests
```
Otherwise, the program accesses the data on it's own, given an internet connection.
