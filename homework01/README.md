# Homework 01

## Script01.py 
This script finds the longest five words in the file saved at `/usr/share/dict/words`, and thus it must be run from the `coe322-login` server, or the file must otherwise be collected.

## Script02.py
This script generates and prints five full names that are exactly 8 characters long, omitting space (`' '`) characters. To do this, the script uses the python `names` library, which can be downloaded as so:

```
pip3 install --user names
```

## Script03.py
This script also uses the `names` library to generate five names of arbitrary length. Names are printed followed by their character length, ommiting space (`' '`) characters.
