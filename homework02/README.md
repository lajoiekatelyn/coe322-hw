# Homework 02: Robot Samples Meteorite Landing Sites on Mars

## Description
This code generates five Martian meteorite landing sites in Syrtis Major. It then calculates the time that it will take a robot to visit all five sites and collect samples..

### part01.py
This script generates five metorite landing sites and their latitude, longitude, and composition, and then adds them to a list of dictionaries according to site id. It then writes the aforementioned list of dictionaries to a JSON file for usage in Part 02.

### part02.py
This script reads the `meteorite_landings.json` file generated by part01.py and uses the great-circle distance formula (function definition is an altered version of the definition provided by Joe Wallen via Slack) to calculate the time the robot spends traveling and taking samples (sample times vary per site composition: 1 hour for stony samples, 2 hours for iron samples, and 3 hours for stony-iron samples).
