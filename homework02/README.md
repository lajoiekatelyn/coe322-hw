# Homework 02: Robot Samples Meteorite Landing Sites on Mars

## Description
This code generates five Martian meteorite landing sites in Syrtis Major. It then calculates the time that it will take a robot to visit all five sites and collect samples..

### generate\_sites.py
This script generates five metorite landing sites and their latitude, longitude, and composition, and then adds them to a list of dictionaries according to site id. It then writes the aforementioned list of dictionaries to a JSON file called `landing_sites.json` and saves them to the script directory for usage in `calculate_trip.py`. This script must be run prior to `calculate_trip.py` is executed.

### calculate\_trip.py
This script reads the `landing_sites.json` file generated by `generate_trips.py` and uses the great-circle distance formula (function definition is an altered version of the definition provided by Joe Wallen via Slack, shown in the codeblock below) to calculate the time the robot spends traveling and taking samples (sample times vary per site composition: 1 hour for stony samples, 2 hours for iron samples, and 3 hours for stony-iron samples).

```
import math
mars_radius = 3389.5    # km

def calc_gcd(latitude_1: float, longitude_1: float, latitude_2: float, longitude_2: float) -> float:
    lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2 = map( math.radians, [latitude_1, longitude_1, latitude_2, longitude_2] )
    d_sigma = math.acos( math.sin(lat1) * math.sin(lat2) + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.cos(abs(lon1-lon2)))
    return ( mars_radius * d_sigma )
```

## Usage

Script `calculate_trip.py` depends on `generate_sites.py` and therefore must be run after `generate_sites.py`. 

To run `generate_sites.py`:

```
python3 generate_sites.py

```

Between running scripts, it may be wise to confirm that `landing_sites.json` was properly generated.

```
cat landing_sites.json
```

The output should resemble this:

```
{
  "sites": [
    {
      "site_id": 1,
      "latitude": 17.251018002564624,
      "longitude": 83.3970279780064,
      "composition": "iron"
    },
    {
      "site_id": 2,
      "latitude": 17.746000689892814,
      "longitude": 83.6341686094379,
      "composition": "iron"
    },
    {
      "site_id": 3,
      "latitude": 16.030853322327715,
      "longitude": 83.25245580655684,
      "composition": "iron"
    },
    {
      "site_id": 4,
      "latitude": 17.620230214040348,
      "longitude": 83.69441198661723,
      "composition": "iron"
    },
    {
      "site_id": 5,
      "latitude": 17.804169521267553,
      "longitude": 82.61539439035306,
      "composition": "iron"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then it is safe to run `calculate_trip.py`:

```
python3 calculate_trip.py
```

Which should output something like the following:

```
leg = 1, time to travel = 10.84, time to sample = 2
leg = 2, time to travel = 13.87, time to sample = 2
leg = 3, time to travel = 7.12, time to sample = 2
leg = 4, time to travel = 13.56, time to sample = 2
leg = 5, time to travel = 11.23, time to sample = 2
===============================
number of legs = 5, total time elapsed = 66.61808027896588
```
